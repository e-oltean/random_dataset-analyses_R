#Backward, forward, and stepwise search are all useful, but do have an obvious
#issue. By not checking every possible model, sometimes they will miss the best
#possible model. With an extremely large number of predictors, sometimes this is
#necessary since checking every possible model would be rather time consuming,
#even with current computers.

#However, with a reasonably sized dataset, it isn’t too difficult to check all 
#pos  sible models. To do so, we will use the regsubsets() function in the R package
#leaps.

W#e’ll now look at the information stored in all_hipcenter_mod.

all_hipcenter_mod$which
#Using $which gives us the best model, according to RSS, for a model of each
#possible size, in this case ranging from one to eight predictors. For example the
#best model with four predictors (p = 5) would use Age, HtShoes, Thigh, and Leg.

#compute RSS
all_hipcenter_mod$rss 

#compute Adjusted R squared

#We can then extract the predictors of that model.
all_hipcenter_mod$which[best_r2_ind, ]

#We can then extract the predictors of the model with the best AIC.
