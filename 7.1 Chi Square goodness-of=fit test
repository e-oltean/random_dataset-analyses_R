#Chi Square r one sample Chi square compares the proportion of cases from a sample 
# with hypothesised values or those previously from a comparison population. Also, is 
# used to determineÂ whether or not a categorical variable follows a hypothesized distribution.
#Example: To test whether the number of smokers in the data is equivalent to that reported in 
#the literature from a previous larger natiowide study (20%). Ex2.all is needed is one categorical 
#variable and a specific proportion against which you wish to test observed frequencies.
# You need one categorical variable with two or more categories (smoker yes/no)
# a hypothesised proportion proportion (20% /80%)





#data creation
observed <- c(50, 60, 40, 47, 53) 
expected_proportion <- c(.2, .2, .2, .2, .2) #must add up to 1

# calculate Chi square 

res=chisq.test(observed, expected_proportion) 

# printing the p-value
res$p.value
