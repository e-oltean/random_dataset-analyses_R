'The sectnd step in the factor analysis is the factor extraction which is the 
smallest number of factors that can be used to best represent the relations among 
variables. The most commonly used approiach is the PCA.'

'Kaiser-Guttman criterion or eigenvalue rule is one technique. Using this rule, 
only factors with an eigenvalue of 1.0 or more are kept for further investigation. 
The eigenvalue of a factor represents the amount of total variance explained by that factor.'

'generate normal dataset'
x=rnorm(100)
y=rnorm(100)
z=rnorm(100)
w=rnorm(100) + x + y + z
data=data.frame(w,x,y,z)

##first method
install.packages("FactoMineR", dependencies = TRUE)
library(FactoMineR)

# Conduct a PCA on the  dataset
pca_data <- PCA(data)

# Apply the Kaiser-Guttman rule
summary(pca_data, ncp = 4)

##second method

KGC <- eigen(cor(data)) # get eigenvalues
KGC$values
