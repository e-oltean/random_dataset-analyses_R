#Backward selection procedures start with all possible predictors in the model,
#then considers how deleting a single predictor will effect a chosen metric. Letâ€™s
#try this on the seatpos data. We will use the step() function in R which by
#default uses AIC as its metric of choice.

# returns both p and AIC
extractAIC(hipcenter_mod)
