#explores the relationship btw two categorical variables with two or 
#more categories. This compares the osberved frequencies or proportion
#of cases in each category with expected values if there was no association
#btw two variables being measured. Ex of categories male/female, smoker/non-smoker.
#Ex of research: is there any association btw gender and smoking? Are males more likely smokers?

#create table
data <- matrix(c(120, 90, 40, 110, 95, 45), ncol=3, byrow=TRUE)
colnames(data) <- c("Left","Right","Ind")
rownames(data) <- c("Male","Female")
data <- as.table(data)

#Perform Chi-Square Test of Independence
chisq.test(data)

#Since the p-value (0.6492) of the test is not less than 0.05, we fail to reject 
#the null hypothesis. This means we do not have sufficient evidence to say that 
#there is an association between variables.
