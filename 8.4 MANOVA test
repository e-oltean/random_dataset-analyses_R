#is an extension of analysis of variance for more than one dependent variable. 
#These dependent variables should be related in some way or should be some reason
#to consider them together.  MANOVA compares the groups and shows whether the mean 
#differences between the groups on the combination of dependent variables are likely 
#to have occurred by chance. To do this, MANOVA creates a new summary dependent variable, 
#which is a linear combination of each of your dependent variable. Considering each variable
#separately increases the likelihood of getting  a Type I error.

#You need: one categorical independent variable (ex: sex) and two or more continuous variables.
#What it does: compares two or more groups in terms of their means on a group of dependent variablkes.
#Tests the null hypothesis that the population means on a set of dependent variables do not vary across
#different levels of a factor or a grouping variable.

summary.aov(result.manova)

#The two variables are extremely significantly different among Species.
