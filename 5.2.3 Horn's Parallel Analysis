##The second step in the factor analysis is the factor extraction

##Horn's parallel analysis involves comparing the size of the  eigenvalues 
##with those randomly generated datasets. We keep only eigenvalues that exceed
##the corresponding values from random dataset. This approach to identifying 
##the correct number of componenets. This is used for reporing in journals as a must.
