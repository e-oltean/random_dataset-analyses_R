#Effect size

#Effect sizecomputes if difference is statistically significant. With large samples even the slightest
#difference can become significant. This does not mean that it has any practical or theoretical significance.
#One way to assess the importance is to compute effect size (or strength of association).

#Partial eta squared indicates the proportuon of variance in the dependent variable that is explained by the 
#variance of the independent variable. Values range from 0 to 1.The value of Eta squared varies from 0 to 1,
#with values closer to 1 indicating that a specific variable in the model can explain a greater fraction of the variation.
#The following are some general guidelines for interpreting Eta squared values:
#  0.01: Effect size is small.
#0.06: Effect size is medium.
#Large effect size if the number is 0.14 or above.

#Dataset Creation

x1=rnorm(100, mean = 50, sd = 200)
y1=rnorm(100, mean = 50, sd = 200)
z1= rnorm(100, mean = 50, sd = 200)
w1=rnorm(100, mean = 50, sd = 200) + x1 + y1 + z1
dfr_nrm=data.frame(x1,y1,z1,w1)

#Fit the ANOVA Model
