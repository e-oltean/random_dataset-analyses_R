#Forward selection is the exact opposite of backwards selection. Here we tell
#R to start with a model using no predictors, that is hipcenter ~ 1, then
#at each step R will attempt to add a predictor until it finds a good model
#or reaches hipcenter ~ Age + Weight + HtShoes + Ht + Seated + Arm +
 # Thigh + Leg.
