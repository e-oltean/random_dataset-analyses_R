#The Tukey HSD test allows for all possible pairwise comparisons 
#while keeping the family-wise error rate low.


#One of the best-known members of the post-hoc world is Tukey’s HSD 
#(Honest Significant Difference) test. This test performs all possible
#pairwise comparisons among the sample means.

#So what’s the story? The story is that Tukey’s test adjusts for the number
#of sample means and compares the differences not to the t-distribution but 
#to the Studentized Range distribution. The overall effect is to make it more 
#difficult to reject the null hypothesis about any pairwise comparison than it 
#would be if you compare the difference against the t-distribution.

#create data
set.seed(1045)

                   values = c(rnorm(40, 0, 3),rnorm (40, 0, 6),rnorm (40, 1, 5)))
head(data)

#create ANOVA model
model <- aov(values~group, data=data)
summary(model)

#perform Tukey HSD Test.
