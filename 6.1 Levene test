#Leveneâ€™s test is an inferential statistic used to check if the variances of a variable 
#obtained for two or more groups are equal or not when data comes from a non-normal distribution. 

#assumptions for parametric tests

#level of measurement -variables should be as much as possible continuous random sampling
#independence of observations
#normal distribution of population from which samples are taken
#homogeneity of variance-samples are taken from populations of equal variances.
#to test this Levene's test for equality. You should get that the test is not significant (significance level must be greater than 0.5
