'Often a small number of data points can  have an extremely large influence on a regression,
sometimes so much so that the regression assumptions are violated as a result of these points.'

'Outliers are points which do not fit the model well. 
They may or may not have a large affect on the model. 
To identify outliers, we will look for observations with large residuals.'
