One of the most important aspects is the choice of the correct statistical tests
to employ in order to analyse the data. While most teachers and books focus on how to calculate a test, they omit to tackle what is the right statistical technique to address certain research topics.This has as a staring point the book entitled "SPSS Survival Manual" by Julie Pallant. But unlike the aforementioned book, we use her approach utilising R which is the main purpose for this project.

Based on the same line of reasoning, we employ R in order to get the same results. We show the code necessary to do that, including the libraries necessary to have access to certain commands and functions. Please note that we aim in addition to the aforementioned book to tackle certain aspects not tackled in the book (such as chosing the most suitable model for the data).

We aim in this project to adress a set of data by justifying the choices for our statistical tests depending on the results of the previous tests. We follow a certain way and order based on a logical manner. 

We aim to investigate on one hand the relationship between variables using correlation (in the third part) and different types of regression(in the fourth part). On the other hand, we want to investigate the relationships between different groups.

In the first part, we adress the topic of suitability of data.
In the second part, we approach the caracteristics of the data in order to explore if the data comply with the assumptions for one statistical techniques. Mainly, we explore normality, linearity, and independence of data. Based on these finding with regard to data characteristics, we go parametric and non-parametric tests. To be continued....
