#In the case where the data in non-normal,
##we will employ the non-parametric ests
# in order to tackle the rdifferences
# between two groups (i.e. 2 continous varibles).

#is used to test differences btw two independent groups
#on a continous measure. It is the non-parametric alternative of t-test.
#But instead of comparing the mean of the groups actually compares medians . 
#It converts the scores on the continous variable to ranks across the two groups.
#Then evaluates whether the ranks for the two groups differ significantly. As the 
#score are converted to ranks, the actualk distribution of the scores does not mattet. 
#You need two variables of which one categorical with two groups (ex sex) and a 
#continuous variable (ex total self-esteem). Ex researcj questions: do female/male 
#differ in their level of esteem, ? Do mles have higher esteem?
