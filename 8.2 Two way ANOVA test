#Two way means there are two independent variables and between groups mean there are
#different people in each group. In one way ANOVA example was about optimism level for 
#three age groups. But it is for both males and females. Two way anova will have two 
#independent variables (age groupand sex).

#create data frame
data <- data.frame(gender = rep(c("Male", "Female"), each = 30),
                   exercise = rep(c("None", "Light", "Intense"), each = 10, times = 2),
                   weight_loss = c(runif(10, -3, 3), runif(10, 0, 5), runif(10, 5, 9),
                                   runif(10, -4, 2), runif(10, 0, 3), runif(10, 3, 8)))

#load dplyr package
library(dplyr)

#find mean and standard deviation of weight loss for each treatment group
data %>%
  group_by(gender, exercise) %>%
  summarise(mean = mean(weight_loss),
            sd = sd(weight_loss))
