#Effect size

#Effect sizecomputes if difference is statistically significant. With large samples even the slightest
#difference can become significant. This does not mean that it has any practical or theoretical significance.
#One way to assess the importance is to compute effect size (or strength of association).

#Cohen's d test
#In statistics, we often use p-values to determine if there is a statistically significant difference between 
#the mean of two groups. However, while a p-value can tell us whether or not there is a statistically significant
#difference between two groups, an effect size can tell us how large this difference actually is.

#Cohenâ€™s d present difference between groups in standard deviation units.

#A d of 0.5 indicates that the two group means differ by 0.5 standard deviations.
#A d of 1 indicates that the group means differ by 1 standard deviation.
#A d of 2 indicates that the group means differ by 2 standard deviations.
