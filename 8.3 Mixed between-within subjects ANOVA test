#combines between subjects design (comparing two or more different groups) and 
#within subjects or repeated measures design (one or more groups exposed to different conditions).
#There are three variables involved: one categorical independent between subjects 
#variable with two or more levels (group1/group), one categorical independent within-subjects
#with two or more levels (time1/time 2…), one continuous dependent variable.
#What it does: it tests if there are main effects for each of the independent variables 
#and whether the interaction between variables.

#The output informs us that, on average, the subjects that listened to classical 
#music did not significantly differ () from those that listened to rock music. 
#However, there is, on average, a significant difference () between each of the 
#subject’s heart rate when put in a room with or without light. Additionally, 
#since the interaction term is not significant (), we can use the additive 
#(no interaction) model.
