##Factor rotation implies to interpret the factors once 
##they were determined or "rotated". Orthogonal rotation
##are easier to interpret but this implies that the factors
#are not correlated, which is usually wrong. Oblique approach
#allows correlation between factors but it is more difficult 
#to interpret. Most use both and report them. Orthogonal options:
##varimax, equamax, quartimax. Oblique options:promax, oblimin. The most popular: promax.
