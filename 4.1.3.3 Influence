'Often a small number of data points can  have an extremely large influence on a regression,
sometimes so much so that the regression assumptions are violated as a result of these points.'

'As we have now seen in the three plots, some outliers only change the regression 
a small amount (plot one) and some outliers have a large effect on the regression (plot three).
Observations that fall into the latter category, points with (some combination of) 
high leverage and large residual, we will call influential.'
