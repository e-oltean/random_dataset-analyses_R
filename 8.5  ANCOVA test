#is an extension of analysis of variance that allows to test the differences between variables 
#while statistically controlling for an additionally continuous variable. The additional variable
#(called covariate) is a variable that you suspect that might be influencing the dependent variable. 

#create dataset
data <- data.frame(technique = rep(c("A", "B", "C"), each = 30),
                   current_grade = runif(90, 65, 95),
                   exam = c(runif(30, 80, 95), runif(30, 70, 95), runif(30, 70, 90)))


#load dplyr
library(dplyr)

data %>%
  group_by(technique) %>%
  summarise(mean_grade = mean(current_grade),
            sd_grade = sd(current_grade),
            mean_exam = mean(exam),
            sd_exam = sd(exam))
#Check the Model Assumptions
#To verify that the covariate and the treatment are independent, 
#we can run an ANOVA using current grade as the response variable 
#and studying technique as the predictor variable:

#fit anova model
anova_model <- aov(current_grade ~ technique, data = data)
#view summary of anova model
summary(anova_model)

#to verify that there is homogeneity of variance among the groups, 
#we can conduct Levene’s Test:

#load car library to conduct Levene's Test
install.packages("car")
library(car)

#conduct Levene's Test
leveneTest(exam~technique, data = data)

#Fit the ANCOVA Model

#load car library
library(car)

#fit ANCOVA model
ancova_model <- aov(exam ~ technique + current_grade, data = data)

#view summary of model
aov(ancova_model, type="III") 

#Although the ANCOVA results told us that studying technique had a statistically significant
#effect on exam scores, we need to run post hoc tests to actually find out which studying techniques 
#differ from each other.To do so, we can use the glht() function within the multcomp package in R to
#perform Tukey’s Test for multiple comparisons:

#load the multcomp library
install.packages("multcomp")
library(multcomp)

#fit the ANCOVA model
ancova_model <- aov(exam ~ technique + current_grade, data = data)

#define the post hoc comparisons to make
postHocs <- glht(ancova_model, linfct = mcp(technique = "Tukey"))

#view a summary of the post hoc comparisons
summary(postHocs)
